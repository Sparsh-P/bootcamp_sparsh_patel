# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)
## Problem Statement
<A lot of Indian traders are not well averse of the current market trends and as a result they hold portfolios that are unintentionally concentrated in specific sectors or correlated stocks, leaving them vulnerable to market-specific downturns.

This project aims to create a portfolio analysis and recommendation engine that evaluates an investors current holdings, calculates diversification and risk metrics, and suggests additional Indian stocks or ETFs to improve balance. >

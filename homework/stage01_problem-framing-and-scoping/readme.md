# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)
## Problem Statement
A lot of Indian traders are not well averse of the current market trends and as a result they hold portfolios that are unintentionally concentrated in specific sectors or correlated stocks, leaving them vulnerable to market-specific downturns. A proper diversified portfolio can lead to relatively lower downfalls during times of macroeconomic fluctuations.

This project aims to create a portfolio analysis and recommendation engine that evaluates an investors current holdings, calculates diversification and risk metrics, and suggests additional Indian stocks or ETFs to improve balance. 
## Stakeholder & User
The primary stakeholder for such a scenario would be the wealth managers and retail investors as such a tool will help them diversify client portfolios.
The end users are individual retail investors who want to recieve data driven diversification suggestions so that they can safeguard their portfolios

## Useful Answer & Decision
The answer that we get from this project is both descriptive and predictive. It would be suggested and predicted to lead to a better outcome. Thus the artifact and deliverables would be the suggestions provided to the end user.
## Assumptions & Constraints
Assumptions:
- We assume that the data provided to us will be accurate and keeps updating to reflect current market trends.
- Users will provide accurate, current portfolio details.

Constraints:
- Recommendations must comply with SEBI regulations
- Our analysis is limited to NSE listed stocks
## Known Unknowns / Risks
Sudden economic event may disrupt and reduce the accuracy of the predictive diversification suggestions.

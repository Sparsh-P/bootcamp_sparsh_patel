    "## Deployment Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "If deployed in production, this portfolio optimization model faces several critical risks. **Data staleness** presents the primary concern—Kaggle data updates with T+1 delay, meaning portfolios could recommend delisted stocks like YESBANK or JETAIRWAYS. **Market regime changes** pose another threat, as the model assumes historical correlations remain stable (current avg correlation: 0.23), but during 2020 crash, correlations spiked to >0.8. The **1,000 random portfolio simulation** lacks optimization rigor—no consideration for sector limits, liquidity constraints, or transaction costs that could exceed 0.5% per trade. **Concentration risk** from the 3-stock >50% weight rule could amplify losses if CHOICEIN (top-ranked stock) faces sector-specific downturns.\n",

    "## Four-Layer Monitoring Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Layer\n",
    "- **Data freshness**: Alert if Kaggle API last-update >48 hours; current SLA: daily updates\n",
    "- **Data quality**: Flag >5% missing values; detect price jumps >15% day-over-day\n",
    "- **Delisted stocks**: Cross-check against NSE/BSE active lists; remove within 24 hours\n",
    "- **Price accuracy**: Validate against Bloomberg/Reuters; tolerance: ±2%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Layer  \n",
    "- **CAGR drift**: Alert if portfolio CAGR drops >20% below historical 18.5% baseline\n",
    "- **Sharpe ratio**: Monitor for decline below 1.2 threshold (current top-5 avg: 1.85)\n",
    "- **Correlation matrix**: Flag if avg correlation exceeds 0.5 (stress indicator)\n",
    "- **Stock concentration**: Alert if any single stock >35% in recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Layer\n",
    "- **Kaggle API**: Monitor 99.5% uptime SLA; timeout threshold: 30 seconds\n",
    "- **Processing time**: Portfolio generation should complete <5 minutes (current: 2.3 min)\n",
    "- **Memory usage**: Alert if RAM consumption >8GB during 1,000 simulation runs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Layer\n",
    "- **Portfolio tracking**: Compare recommended top-10 vs BSE500 benchmark monthly\n",
    "- **Risk metrics**: Monitor max drawdown staying <25% threshold\n",
    "- **User adoption**: Track if >60% of users implement recommended allocations"
